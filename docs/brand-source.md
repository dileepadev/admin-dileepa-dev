# Brand source

Brand version **2.1.0**, vendored from [`dileepadev`](https://github.com/dileepadev/dileepadev)'s
`docs/brand/`, which owns the originals.

| Canonical source in `dileepadev` | Copy here | Adaptation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/brand/brand-tokens.css` | `app/brand-tokens.css` | Remove only the Google Fonts import; load the same faces and weights through next/font in app/layout.tsx |
| `docs/brand/brand-tokens.css` | `docs/brand-tokens.css` | None |
| `docs/brand/brand-guide.md` | `docs/brand-guide.md` | None |
| `docs/brand/design-system.md` | `docs/design-system.md` | None |
| `DESIGN.md` | `DESIGN.md` | None |
| `docs/brand/favicon/favicon.ico` | `app/favicon.ico` | None |
| `docs/brand/favicon/`, `og.png`, `og2.png`, `profile-picture/` | `public/` (every file the website serves from its own `public/`) | None. Copied from the website's `v2.1.0` tag, so the manifest names the website; it is not linked from the layout |

Canonical token SHA-256: `df57c8ad86d947839a9643355359bfee3d8775bc1023aa562eafc58203c9fc71`.

The runtime sheet's vendor header records the source and sole font-loading
adaptation. Components use semantic variables; do not patch either copy or
copy palette values into components. Application layout rules belong in the
app's global styles. Both themes use Manrope 400/500/700 and JetBrains Mono
400/500.

To refresh, copy the files from the root's latest release, preserve only the
documented font-loading adaptation, and run the app's checks and both-theme
browser review. These vendored files are not another asset host.
